**Django Authentication API**

This Django project implements a comprehensive authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Token) and Django Rest Framework (DRF). The API provides secure user authentication, including registration, login, and password reset functionalities, along with mechanisms to prevent brute force attacks and manage user roles and permissions.

Features
**JWT Authentication:** Secure token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens.

**User Registration:** New users can register by providing their email and password.

**User Login**: Registered users can log in to receive a JWT token for authentication.

**Password Reset**: Secure password reset functionality, including token generation and email-based reset process.

**Brute Force Attack Prevention**: Implementing strategies to prevent brute force attacks on login endpoints.

**User Management**: Role-based access control (RBAC) with permissions for different user roles (e.g., Admin,moderator, User).
